<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

### Built With

This section is actually mostly empty since I tried to keep the dependencies to a minimum. That said, there are some projects that made my life a lot easier:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [nanoid](https://github.com/ai/nanoid)
- [Nx](https://nx.dev/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- Install pnpm folowing the instructions [here](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Installation

1. Create new project if you haven't already. I like vite for this, but you can use whatever you want.

   ```sh
   pnpx create-vite my-project --template vanilla-ts
   ```

1. Install asimov-ts

   ```sh
   pnpm add @asimov-ts/core @asimov-ts/web
   ```

That's it! You can now start using the engine.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage
